# Alternate Forms of $p \rightarrow q$

1. **If $p$, then $q$**  
   → Whenever $p$ happens, $q$ must follow.

2. **If $p$, $q$**  
   → $p$ leads directly to $q$.

3. **$q$, if $p$**  
   → $q$ occurs provided that $p$ does.

4. **$p$ only if $q$**  
   → For $p$ to be true, $q$ must be true.

5. **$p$ is sufficient for $q$**  
   → $p$ being true guarantees that $q$ is true.

6. **$q$ is necessary for $p$**  
   → Without $q$, $p$ cannot be true.

7. **Contrapositive: $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$**  
   → If $q$ is false, then $p$ must also be false.

8. **Logical equivalence: $p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg p \lor q$**  
   → Either $p$ is false, or $q$ is true.

9. **Alternate form: $p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg(p \wedge \neg q)$**  
   → It's not the case that $p$ is true and $q$ is false.

> **Note:** The **converse**, $q \rightarrow p$, may look similar but is **not logically equivalent** to $p \rightarrow q$.
