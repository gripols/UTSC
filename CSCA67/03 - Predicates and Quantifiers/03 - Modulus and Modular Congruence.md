## Modulus (mod)

The **modulus operator** returns the **remainder** after dividing one number by another.

**Definition:**  
If $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b > 0$, then:

- $a \mod b$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$

**Example:**

- $10 \mod 3 = 1$ because $10 = 3 \times 3 + 1$

### Modular Congruence

We say two integers $a$ and $b$ are **congruent modulo** $n$ if they leave the same remainder when divided by $n$.

- This is written as: $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$

**Example:**

- $10 \equiv 7 \pmod{3}$ because both $10 \mod 3 = 1$ and $7 \mod 3 = 1$
