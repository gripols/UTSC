The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** says:

> Every integer greater than 1 is either a **prime** number or can be written as a **unique product of prime numbers** (up to the order of the factors).

This means that **prime factorization is unique**.

### Examples of Prime Factorization

| Number | Prime Factorization              |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 16     | $2^4$                            |
| 18     | $2^1 \cdot 3^2$                  |
| 21     | $3^1 \cdot 7^1$                  |

**Note:** For completeness, factors like $2^0$ or $5^0$ may be shown when using all primes ≤ a certain bound, but they equal 1 and don’t affect the value.

### Definitions

- A **prime number** is an integer greater than 1 that has **no positive divisors** other than 1 and itself.
  - Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
- A **composite number** is a positive integer that is **not prime** (i.e., it has more than two positive divisors).
  - Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...
