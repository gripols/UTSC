**Evolution**: A change in the genetic structure of a population from one generation to the next.  
- Also known as “descent with modification” — *Darwin*

## Basic Tenets of (19th Century) Biblical Creationism

1. The Earth was created by God relatively recently  
   - Estimated age: ~6,000 years
2. Large-scale changes to the Earth’s surface are the result of major catastrophes (*Catastrophism*)
3. Living things do not change through time (*Fixity of Species*)  
   - *Great Chain of Being*: The concept of a chain with hierarchical steps occupied by different levels of complexity  
     - God at the top, followed by angels, humans, animals, etc.  
     - Implies a fundamental organization of creatures — incompatible with the concept of evolution
4. Fossils can be explained away  
   - If everything was created by God, why would some things go extinct?

## Uniformitarianism

**Definition**: The theory that the Earth's features are the result of long-term processes that continue to operate today as they did in the past  
- *The present is the key to the past*  
- Contrasts with *Catastrophism*  
- Uses modern processes to explain and date old formations (e.g., Grand Canyon)

---

## James Hutton (1726–1797)

- Developed the idea of Earth as a self-regulating system  
- Key contributor to Uniformitarianism  
- Believed that Earth-shaping processes in the past are of the same magnitude as those observable today

---

## Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875)

- Wrote *Principles of Geology* (1830–1833)  
- Popularized Uniformitarianism  
  - Used this framework to calculate the age of geological formations  
  - Though his calculations were incorrect, he established that Earth is much older than 6,000 years  
  - Helped break down belief in a “young Earth”

## Adaptation

**Definition**: A feature of an organism that increases the likelihood of its survival and reproduction in a particular environment

---

## Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829)

- Proposed the *inheritance of acquired characteristics*  
- Argued that organisms adapted to their environment through their actions in life  
  - e.g., Giraffes stretched their necks to reach high food, and this trait was passed on  
- While incorrect, his ideas influenced future evolutionary thinking

---

## Thomas Malthus (1766–1834)

- Wrote *Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798)  
  - Observed that while food supply remains relatively constant, populations can grow indefinitely  
  - Plants and animals produce more offspring than can survive  
  - Populations increase exponentially, but resources do not

---

## Charles Darwin (1809–1882)

- Wrote:
  - *On the Origin of Species* (1859)  
  - *The Descent of Man* (1871)  
- Developed his ideas during a voyage on a British survey ship  
  - Made extensive natural observations  
- Proposed that humans evolved from earlier forms of life

## Adaptive Radiation

**Definition**: The evolution of multiple divergent species from a single, less specialized ancestral species  
- e.g., A single bird arrives in the Galápagos; its descendants diversify to exploit various ecological niches due to reduced competition

---

## Basic Tenets of Natural Selection

1. Variation exists within populations  
2. Variation is heritable  
3. Some variants are better adapted to their environment  
4. All organisms produce more offspring than can survive  
5. Offspring of better-adapted individuals are more likely to survive  
6. These offspring inherit their parents' adaptations  
7. Over time, this leads to changes in population traits  
8. Over long timescales, this process leads to large-scale changes, including speciation  
   - (Inspired by Malthus’s idea of limited resources)

## Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913)

- From a middle-class background  
- Traveled and collected biological specimens to earn a living  
- Wrote *On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type* (1858)  
  - Sent this paper to Darwin, who had been working on similar ideas  
  - Described the concept of natural selection independently
