## Descriptive Grammar

- Describes **how language is actually used**.
- Used by linguists to analyze real-world speech and dialects.

### Key Principles

1. All language varieties are valid.
2. No language is expected to follow anotherâ€™s structure.
3. Language evolves without becoming worse.
4. Borrowing words is natural.
5. Grammar rules vary by dialect, not correctness.
