## Standard vs Non-Standard Language

- **Standard Language**: Used by powerful groups; considered “correct.”
- **Non-Standard**: Still grammatical; just different from the standard.

### Key Ideas

- Non-standard != incorrect.
- Dialects have their own valid rules.
- What’s ungrammatical in one dialect may be fine in another.
