## Reduplication

- Repetition of a **part or all** of a base word to indicate a grammatical or semantic change.

### Types:

- **Partial Reduplication**: repeats part of a word (e.g., syllable or sound).
- **Full Reduplication**: entire base is duplicated.

### Example (Full)

- Hypothetical: *bye-bye* or *go-go*

> Reduplication is more common in other languages but exists marginally in English.
