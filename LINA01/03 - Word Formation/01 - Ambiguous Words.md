## Ambiguous Words

- An **ambiguous word** has **more than one meaning**.
- This ambiguity comes from **multiple possible internal structures**, each representing a different interpretation.
- In linguistic analysis, this means the word can have **more than one tree diagram**, each corresponding to a different structure and meaning.

### Common Examples

1. **Unlockable**  
   - Can mean "able to be unlocked" → *unlock + able*  
   - Or "not able to be locked" → *un + lockable*  
   - Each reading corresponds to a different structure.

2. **Unfoldable**  
   - Can mean "able to be unfolded"  
   - Or "not able to be folded"

### Important Notes

- In this course, ambiguous words will generally follow the pattern:  
  `un + [root] + able`
- **Not all words** with *un-* and *-able* are ambiguous.  
  - E.g., **Unbelievable** is *not* ambiguous, because *unbelieve* is not a valid word.
