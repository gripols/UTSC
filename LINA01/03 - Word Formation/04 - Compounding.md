## Compounding

- Combines **two or more roots**, **words**, or **free morphemes** into one word.
- The resulting word typically belongs to a **noun**, **verb**, or **adjective** category.

### Headedness

- The **head** of a compound determines its **lexical category** and **core meaning**.
- In English, the **second element** is typically the head.

  - E.g. *blackboard* → **board** is the head → it's a noun.

### Stress Pattern

- **Compound words**: primary stress on the **first** word (*BLACKboard*)
- **Non-compound phrases**: stress on the **second** word (*black BOARD*)

### Types of Compounds

- **Endocentric**: Meaning comes from the head.  
  - E.g. *train ticket*, *blackboard*, *earthworm*
- **Exocentric**: Meaning not predictable from the head.  
  - E.g. *redhead*, *boldface*, *bluebell*
