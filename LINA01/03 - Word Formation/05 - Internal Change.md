## Internal Change

- A form of **inflection** involving a **non-morphemic substitution** within the word.
- Typically involves a vowel shift — known as **ablaut**.

### Examples (Ablaut)

- *Sing* → *Sang*  
- *Drive* → *Drove*  
- *Swim* → *Swam*

> The vowel change alone conveys grammatical info (usually tense).
