## Word Formation Processes

Linguists categorize new word creation through the following processes:

- **Derivation** – Adding affixes to create new words.
- **Compounding** – Combining whole words.
- **Internal Change** – Altering part of the word’s internal structure.
- **Suppletion** – Replacing a word entirely.
- **Reduplication** – Repeating part or all of a base.
- **Zero Derivation / Conversion** – Changing lexical category without changing form.
- **Clipping** – Shortening multisyllabic words.
- **Blending** – Merging parts of multiple words.
- **Backformation** – Removing a (real or assumed) affix.
- **Acronyms** – Using initials pronounced as a new word.
- **Initialism / Abbreviations** – Using initials pronounced individually.
- **Coinage** – Inventing words from scratch.
- **Eponymy** – Creating words from people's names.
