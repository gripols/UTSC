## Derivation

- Involves adding **derivational affixes** to a word to create a **new word** with a new meaning or grammatical category.
- Derivation can involve:
  - **Prefixation** – Adding a prefix: *un+kind*
  - **Suffixation** – Adding a suffix: *kind+ness*

### Complex Derivation

- Occurs when multiple derivational affixes are applied.
- These can produce **multi-level tree diagrams**.
- Example: *Un+friend+ly*
  - Multiple affixes → hierarchical word structure.

> Not all tree structures are valid — some combinations violate morphological rules.
