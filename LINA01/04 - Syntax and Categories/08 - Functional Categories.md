## Functional (Closed Class) Categories

- Express **grammatical function**, not content.
- Limited number of members.
- Rarely admit new words.

### Main Functional Categories:

- **Determiners (Det)**
- **Degree Words (Deg)**
- **Auxiliary Verbs (Aux)**

> These are **essential for grammaticality**, even if they donâ€™t carry meaning.
