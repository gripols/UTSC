## Syntactic Knowledge (What You Know Unconsciously)

As a native speaker, you can:

1. **Construct grammatical sentences**
2. **Recognize ambiguity** and identify all possible meanings
3. **Identify relationships between related sentences**
4. **Detect the following:**
   - Word order rules
   - Grammatical roles (Subject, Object, etc.)

> This knowledge is **unconscious** and applies to your native language automatically.
