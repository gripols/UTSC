## Generative / Transformational Grammar

- Introduced by **Noam Chomsky** in *Syntactic Structures* (1957).
- Views grammar as a **generative system** that can produce all possible grammatical sentences.

## Universal Grammar (UG)

- The idea that **all human languages share a common core** of grammatical principles.
- UG includes:
  - Structural categories (e.g., noun, verb)
  - Operations (e.g., movement)
  - Constraints on how sentences can be formed

> Despite differences in surface forms, **all languages follow similar underlying syntactic principles**.
