## Syntax Overview

- **Syntax** is the study of **sentence structure** and how words combine to form sentences.
- Words are **not the smallest units** of language; they have internal structure governed by syntactic rules.
- Syntax identifies **patterns** in word combinations and explains why certain word sequences are grammatical while others are not.

> Sentences are **not just word lists** â€” they are structured combinations that obey specific syntactic rules.
