## Constituents in Syntax

- In syntax, a **constituent** is a group of words that functions as a unit within a sentence.
- Sentences are **not flat lists of words**â€”they are **hierarchically structured** through constituents.
- Constituents are also called **phrases**.

### Every sentence has two main constituents:

1. **Subject**:  
   - The **doer** or **experiencer** of the action or state.
   - Always a **Noun Phrase (NP)**.
   - The **head** of a subject phrase is a **noun**.

2. **Predicate**:  
   - Everything **other than the subject**.
   - Describes an action, state, or condition involving the subject.
   - Always a **Verb Phrase (VP)**.
   - The **head** of the predicate is a **verb**.
