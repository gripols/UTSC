## Rules for Identifying Phrases (Constituents)

- **Constituents** can consist of:
  - A single word (e.g., a noun)
  - Or a group of words (e.g., a noun with modifiers)

### General Phrase Rules

| Phrase Type | Must Include        | Can Include              | Head Type |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| NP          | Noun                | Det, ADJP, PP             | Noun       |
| VP          | Verb                | NP, PP, ADVP              | Verb       |
| PP          | Preposition + NP    | â€”                         | Preposition|
| ADJP        | Adjective           | Degree Word               | Adjective  |
| ADVP        | Adverb              | Degree Word               | Adverb     |

### Key Reminders

- A **preposition + NP** always forms a **PP**.
- The **NP inside a PP** is a separate constituent.
- Adjectives form **ADJPs**, even when standalone.
- Use both **form** (what it looks like) and **function** (what it does) to determine the phrase.

> Understanding phrase structure helps you interpret sentence **meaning**, **ambiguity**, and **grammatical relations**.
