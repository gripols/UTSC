## Phrase Structure Examples

---

### Example 1:
**Sentence**: *The children are playing in the park.*

#### Constituents Identified:

1. **NP** → *The children* (Subject)  
2. **VP** → *are playing in the park* (Predicate)  
3. **PP** → *in the park*  
4. **NP** (within PP) → *the park*

> Even though *are playing* is the main predicate, we **don’t list it separately again** when identifying phrases.

### Example 2:
**Sentence**: *The smart students of linguistics submitted their assignments today.*

#### Constituents Identified:

1. **NP** → *The smart students of linguistics* (Subject)  
2. **VP** → *submitted their assignments today* (Predicate)  
3. **PP** → *of linguistics*  
4. **NP** → *linguistics* (inside PP)  
5. **ADJP** → *smart*  
6. **NP** → *their assignments*  
7. **ADVP** → *today*

> Phrases can **nest** inside one another. For example, *of linguistics* is a PP inside the larger NP *the smart students of linguistics*.
