## Bases

- A **base** is the form to which affixes attach.
- All **roots** are bases, but not all **bases** are roots.
- Affix count = base count.
- Affix **order matters**.

### Examples:

- *Unhappy*: 
  - *happy* = root and base
  - *unhappy* = not a base (no further affixes attach)

- *Joblessness*:
  - *job* = root and base
  - *jobless* = base (can take more affixes)
  - *joblessness* = not a base
