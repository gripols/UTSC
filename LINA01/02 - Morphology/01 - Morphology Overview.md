## Morphology Overview

- The branch of linguistics that studies words and their structures.
- Language is creative; humans can produce and understand infinite sentences.
- Our mental lexicon stores sounds and simple words.
- A **word** is the smallest **free form** in language.
- A **free form** is an element that doesnâ€™t require a fixed position relative to neighbors.
- Words are structured but are **not** the smallest units of meaning.
