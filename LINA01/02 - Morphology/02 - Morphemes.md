## Morphemes

- The **smallest units of meaning**.
- Example: **Unhappy** has 2 morphemes → *un* + *happy*.
- Morphemes must contribute meaning:
  - "Delight" = 1 morpheme. “De” and “light” don’t add meaning here.
- **Simple word**: 1 morpheme (e.g. *desk*, *chair*).
- **Complex word**: more than 1 morpheme (e.g. *wishful*, *joyful*).
- **Free morphemes**: stand alone as words (e.g. *joy*, *cry*).
- **Bound morphemes**: must attach to another morpheme (e.g. *-ness*, *-ed*, *-ful*).
